HAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
VEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
OT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
 LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
HE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
ALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
ONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
E'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
UMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS
HE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
HE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
HESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS
TACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
HE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
N SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
TACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
OU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
UMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
I THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
TACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
HERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
EEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
LMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
RUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
