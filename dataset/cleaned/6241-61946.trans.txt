 BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
ANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
UR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
EOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR
E TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
HEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
 COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
NOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
E MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
 SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
Y ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
ERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
 FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
ITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
T CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
 TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
HESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
O RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
N ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
UT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
T LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
E SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
 THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
CCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
