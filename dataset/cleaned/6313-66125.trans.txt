OU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE
OOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT
ES AGREED TAD THAT DOES LOOK LIKE BUSHES
ON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
ND THAT TUMBLE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN
 COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND
O I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD
 AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS
ASTER TAD IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPROVINGLY
 PROTEST SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR
OU'D HAVE BOTH OF US AT THE BOTTOM IF I LEFT IT TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END
E SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE
RE YOU READY YES
E TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
HE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
LOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU
FTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
IGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
 SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
E'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
ODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
IGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
UT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
EBBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE EH GLARED LIGE
HALL WE HAUL UP ASKED LIGE MAKING A MEGAPHONE OF HIS HANDS YES HAUL AWAY
URE THING ANSWERED THE BOY
OR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
