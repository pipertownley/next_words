E REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
HE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
UR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
ROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
HE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
 AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
AYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
 SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
Y GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
 MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
E DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
 THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
E KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
INE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
AD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
HE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
 CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
HE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
E WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
E WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE
E WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
AKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
HE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
E WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
 SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
 THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
S I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
 LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
E WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
UT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
E WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
EFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
UR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
