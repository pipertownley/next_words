HEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
ILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS
HAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
HE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
HEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
HE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME
ONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
T WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
LORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
ELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
ARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
OW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
 FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
ASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
ES CHARCOAL
O THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
HE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
ONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
ITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
OT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
RING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
O I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ECTURES
HE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
