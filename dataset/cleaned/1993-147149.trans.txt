HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY
THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
