 THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
D NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
 LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
 MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
SSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
D HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
 COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
E PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
 CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
EN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
AT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
T AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
EVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
ES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
EN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
T TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
ZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
 IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
RHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
SSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
ZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
 YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
 HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
D ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
T IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
D BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
D HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
