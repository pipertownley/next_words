T WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULLY VEOLAN CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
HE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
CCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON
HE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOG BILL
ET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA
HIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHT AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
T WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARCH THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
HE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE INCLOSURE
T HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
EITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
TABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
WO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE INCLOSURE
HIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
HE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
VERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP
