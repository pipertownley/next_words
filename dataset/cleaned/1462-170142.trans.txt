THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
AFTER THE VERY FIRST
HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
