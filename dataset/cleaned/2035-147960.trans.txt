SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
OTTO WINKED AT ME
A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
