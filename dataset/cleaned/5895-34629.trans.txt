T WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
HE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
AINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
E ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
T MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
T WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
GAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
HE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
Y THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
E ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
HEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
ITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
LL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
HE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
WYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
ESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
VEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
HAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
T TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
HE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
HESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
ESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
RSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
T EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
HE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
HIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
E DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
HICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
IS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
HEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
NE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
HAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
E WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
T THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
