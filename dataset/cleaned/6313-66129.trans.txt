E NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
ITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS
OLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
E DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD
ND WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU ANNOUNCED STACY SWELLING WITH PRIDE
AM EXCLAIMED CHUNKY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYEING THE DISH LONGINGLY
OW FALL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR
 AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
E BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
RESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES
 RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW
ES THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF CAVES
HIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT
UT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
UPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
S YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
HE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
HE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
N EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
 TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
HE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
T WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN
LL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
ALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
HEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
RASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
HEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
HE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
AD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
HE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
HAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
AT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
HY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
NCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
T THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
S A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
