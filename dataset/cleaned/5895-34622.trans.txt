HAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
N GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
HAT WAS THIS NOTHING
ROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
HE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
HIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
N THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
HE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
HIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
NKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
HE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
OME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
HE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
HIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
OR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
HOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
RSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
HIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
HE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
 LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
RSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
HEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
HIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
RSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
