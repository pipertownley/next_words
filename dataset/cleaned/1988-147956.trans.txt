FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX
OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM
IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL
NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO
PRESENTLY AGAINST ONE OF THOSE BANKS I SAW A SORT OF SHED THATCHED WITH THE SAME WINE COLORED GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE
VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED
YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE
MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK
THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER
HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS
SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
