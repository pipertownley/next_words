NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL
RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS
I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
I'M AFRAID HE SAID
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
YOU CAN'T DO IT
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY
