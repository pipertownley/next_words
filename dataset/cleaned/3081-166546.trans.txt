WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
GEORGE NODDED
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
GEORGE
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
WHAT DOES HE WANT
I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
NO DOUBT
SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
YES
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
YES MANY TIMES
WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
