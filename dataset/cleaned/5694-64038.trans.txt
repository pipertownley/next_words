DVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
ANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
E PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON
UTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
E SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
E WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
 YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
HEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
 MAN IN THE WELL
HE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
IGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
UT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
HE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
E LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
 DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
E WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
E HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
OW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
E WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
E WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
UT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW
OU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
HOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
HE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
 REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
E HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
