ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER
IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YES I KNOW VERY WELL
ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
