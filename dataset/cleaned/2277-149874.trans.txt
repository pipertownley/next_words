MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET
THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER
IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
