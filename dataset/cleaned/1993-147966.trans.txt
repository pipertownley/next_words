THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
