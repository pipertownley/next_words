 IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
ESTIVE YES
HE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
T APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
HE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
HERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
OW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
 HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
NDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
 HAD NO ILLUSIONS
 DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
LL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
 FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
 EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
T WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
E WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
T IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
HEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
O ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
HERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
HEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
N IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
 DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
 DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
 WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
 HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
ERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
HERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
HERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
HERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
O ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
ETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
AYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
HE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
RESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
 VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE
HE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
HERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
HO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
 TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN
FTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
E'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
