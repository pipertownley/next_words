WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
