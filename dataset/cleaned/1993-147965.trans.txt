GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
