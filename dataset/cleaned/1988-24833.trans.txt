HE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
OMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
HE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA
HEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME
IGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
 EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGY ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS
OP IT'S A COURSE
E DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN A ROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
OMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUH
O HE CARES HUH
ESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE
S LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT
 GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH
OP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL
OU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
T'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF
 HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
ELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
 LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
 TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL
T'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
 TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA
OM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
OM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
OU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY

ERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
