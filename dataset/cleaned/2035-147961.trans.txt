PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
YES HOW MANY
TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
