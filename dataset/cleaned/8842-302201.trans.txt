THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D
WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR
IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS
IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER
THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
