UT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
NE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
HILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
 COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
HREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
ROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
EANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
HE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI
URIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
ABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
NE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
ONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
HE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
T WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
T LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
UT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS
ECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
 THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
UT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
HERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
PRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
E SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
E WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
HREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY
N THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
HERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
