FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
WHAT THEN MY LORD
GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
